TODO
- sane configuration, cfg file? for ExifTool at least and perhaps to safe last used input / output dir
- logger with file configuration isntead of using the same logger in every module
- gui - PySimpleGUI or Gooey? Would be nice to be able to run both cli and gui. Possible with gooey?
- improve tests and / or functionality for DST changes (currently used timestamp does not include TZ)
- test that it survives other bracketed images (exposure, flash..) and other high speed bursts
- consider OOP and actual data structures
- installer (windows exe). Gooey? pyinstaller?
