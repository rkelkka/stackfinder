TODO
- logger with file configuration isntead of using the same logger in every module
- improve tests and / or functionality for DST changes (currently used timestamp does not include TZ)
- test that it survives other bracketed images (exposure, flash..) and other high speed bursts
- consider OOP and actual data structures
