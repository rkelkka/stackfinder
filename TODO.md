TODO
- implement output
- any need to mark / move which files have been processed? in order to know if safe to delete etc.. consider xmp tags or keywords..
- sane configuration, cfg file? for ExifTool at least and perhaps to safe last used input / output dir
- logger with file configuration isntead of using the same logger in every module
- gui - PySimpleGUI?
- improve tests and / or functionality for DST changes (currently used timestamp does not include TZ)
- test that it survives other bracketed images (exposure, flash..) and other high speed bursts
- consider OOP and actual data structures
